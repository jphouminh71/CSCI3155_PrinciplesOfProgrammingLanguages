    "# Operations on Inductively Defined Structures\n",

    "Previously we looked at inductive definitions starting with numbers, lists, binary trees, artihmetic expressions and simple interpretive language. However , beyond defining them, we didn't look at much else. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture will explore the variety of operations on inductively defined defined structures we have defined so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine two mechanisms for defining these operations: \n",
    "    -Using a 'visitor' patter\n",
    "        - implement the operation as member function as we will see \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Using pattern matching; this is a special feature of functional languages like scala, lisp, caml, and haskell. You can also find these libraries in python. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The first option is generally applicable to most languages. The second option is very special and very powerful. We will focus extensively on the second option of pattern matching, while mentioning what a 'visitor' pattern is. "
