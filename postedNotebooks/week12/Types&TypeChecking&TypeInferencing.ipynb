    "The program is considered mistyped since the function f does not have a definite return type: It returns a number or a boolean depending on the value of x. \n",

    "The goal of a type checker is to take an annotated lettuce program and compute its type. If the program is successfully computed, we also conclude that is is well typed and in doing so, we calculate the type of each expression.

    "    The program is actually typed correctly, however, the fact that it divides by zero is not part of our tpye system and we will note that is is in general undecidable. We will call these runtime errors. \n",
