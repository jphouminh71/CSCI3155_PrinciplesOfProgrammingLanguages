    "We will now introduce our first langauge called lettuce, a language with let bindings. This language is inspired by an existing family of langauges called ML(Meta Language), which has been implemented in general purpose languages such as SML, OCAML, ELM and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lettuce language will illustrate the following important concepts: \n",
    "    * Immutable data: Environemnts\n",
    "    * Function calls, closures and recursive functions\n",
    "    * Mutable data through references \n",

    "## Let Bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let bindings allow us to bind an identifier to a value and use it inside a body expression, using the syntax of the following form. \n",
    "\n",
    "    let (symbolName) = (defining expression) in (body expression) \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice writing some programs in Lettuce ( no pun intended )\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "    let x = 3.5 in x + x\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it defines a symbol named x. The defining expression here is 3.5, and thus evaluates to 3.5. The body expression is x + X. \n",
    "\n",
    "With x bound to 3.5 the answer will evaluate to 7.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the whole expression can be successfully rewritten as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "__eval__ ( \"let x = 3.5 in x + x\") -->Â  __eval__( 3.5 + 3.5 ) --> __eval__ (7.0) -->  7.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can now nest let binding as follows:\n",
    "        let x = 3.0 in \n",
    "            let y = 4.5 - x in \n",
    "                x + 2.0 * y \n",
    "\n",
    "This has two let bindings: \n",
    "Outer binding: \n",
    "    let x = 3.0 in ((body expression #1))\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer binding defines symbol x to the defining expression 3.0 and the body expression # 1 is given by \n",
    "    let y = 4.5 in x + 2.0 * y\n",
    " \n",
    "defines the symbol y to the defining expression 4.5 - x and the in the body expression # 2 is given by x + 2.0 * y \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have picked that apart, let us evaluate this expression ourselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "__eval__(\"let x = 3.0 in let y = 4.5 - x in x + 2.0 * y\") --> __eval__ (\" let y = 4.5 - 3.0 in 3.0 + 2.0 * y \" ) \n",
    " -->  __eval__(\"let y = 1.5 in 3.0 + 2.0 * y\") --> __eval__ (3.0 + 2.0 * 1.5) --> __eval__(6.0) --> 6.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "Let us do one more with different nesting of let bindings. \n",
    "\n",
    "    let x = ( let y = 5 in y * y ) in \n",
    "           let z = 15 * x in \n",
    "                   x - z \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we saw body expressions having let bindings. Now we can allow let bindings for the defining expressions as well. \n",
    "    let x = (defining expression $ 1) in (body expression #1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Defining epxression # 1 itself is \n",

    "    2. Associate the symbol sym with result from step 1\n",
