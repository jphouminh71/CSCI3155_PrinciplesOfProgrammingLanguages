    "### Lettuce: Salad for CSCI 3155 \n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce our first language called lettuce, a language with let bindings. This langauge is inspired by an existing family of lanaguages called ML (meta langauages), which has been implemented in general purpose langauges such as SML, OCAML, ELM and so on. The Lettuce langauge will illustrate the following important concepts: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Immutable data: environments\n",
    "    * Function calls, closures and recursive functions. \n",
    "    * Mutable data through references. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Lets build some example programs to understand the central concept in our let language: the 'let' binding. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let Bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let bindings allow us to bind an identifier to a value and use it inside of a body expression, using the syntax in the following form. \n",
    "\n",
    "let (symbolname) = (defining expression) in (body expression) \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets practice writing programs in Lettuce (no pun intended) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    let x = 3.5 in x + x \n",
    "    \n",
    "First of all, it defines a symbol named x. The defining expression here is 3.5, and thus evaluates to 3.5. The body expression is x + x. With x bound to 3.5, what does this evaluate too? The answer is 7.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the whole expression can be rewritten as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now nest bindings as follows: \n",
    "```\n",
    "    let x = 3.0 in \n",
    "        let y = 4.5 - x in \n",
    "            x + 2.0 * y      \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This has two let bindings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer binding: \n",
    "    let x = 3.0 in ((body expression #1)) \n",
    "    \n",
    "defines the symbol x in the defining expression 3.0 and the body expression #1 is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "    let y = 4.5 in x + 2.0 * y \n",
    "    \n",
    "defines the symbol 'y' to the defining expression 4.5 - x and the body expression #2 is given by x + 2.0 * y\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have picked it apart, let us evaluate this expression ourselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "__eval__(\"let x=3.0 in let y=4.5 - x in x + 2.0y\") -> \n",
    "\n",
    "__eval__(\"let y = 4.5 - 3.0 in 3.0 + 2.0y) -> \n",
    "\n",
    "__eval__(3.0 + 2.0*1.5) -> \n",
    "\n",
    "__eval__(6.0) --> \n",
    "\n",
    "6.0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us do one more differnetn nesting of let bindings. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    let x = (let y = 5 in y * y ) in \n",
    "        let z = 15 * x in \n",
    "            x - z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we saw body expressions having let bindings. Now we can allow let bindings for the defining expressions as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "    let x = (defining expression #1) in (body expression #1) \n",
    "    \n",
    "Defining expression #1 \n",
    "    \n",
    "        let y = 5 in y * y \n",
    "        \n",
    "The body expression #1 is \n",
    "    \n",
    "        let z = 15 * x in x - z \n",
    "        \n",
    "How do we evaluate it? Now is a good time to break up the evaluation of this let binding         \n",
    "    \n",
    "        let sym = (defining expression) in (body expression)\n",
    "        \n",
    "as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Evaluate the defining expression : eval(defining expression) \n",
    "    2. Associate the smybol sym with the result from step 1 \n",
    "    3. Evaluate the body expression but now remember the association from step 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Let bindings in Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala does not have let bindings with the same syntax but it has let bindings through the 'val' declaration. \n",
    "```\n",
    "    val x = 10 \n",
    "    val y = x + 10 \n",
    "    val z = y + 10 \n",
    "    (x + y + z) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we ahve assinged x to 10 and y to x + 10 and then z to y + 10 with x+y+z being the overall value of our code fragment above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare with how we could write something similar in Lettuce. \n",
    "```\n",
    "    let x = 10 in \n",
    "        let.y = x + 10 in \n",
    "            let z = y + 10 in \n",
    "                x + y + z \n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is another example in Scala: \n",
    "```\n",
    "    val z = {\n",
    "        val x = 10 \n",
    "        val y = 15 \n",
    "        x + y\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return z + 10 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lettuce, we could would write \n",
    "```\n",
    "    let z = {\n",
    "        let x = 10 in \n",
    "            let y = 15 in \n",
    "                x + y \n",
    "                \n",
    "    }\n",
    "        in \n",
    "            z + 10 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you appreciate how let bindingsalso arise in scala without the let id = defining-expr in body-expr syntax \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoping in Lettuce\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now important to understand scoping rules. Scoping rules allows us to understand which let bindings applies to a given identifeier x. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following progrma\n",
    "```\n",
    "    let y = 15 in \n",
    "        let x = 10 in x + y \n",
    "```\n",
    "Consider the expression x + y. You can undesrtand which let binding has defined x an which let binding has defined y. \n",
    "\n",
    "However consider the more complicated case: \n",
    "```\n",
    "    let x = 10 in \n",
    "    let x = 10 in \n",
    "    let x = x + 10 in \n",
    "        x + 10 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are repeatedly defining x, however the right hand sides refer back to the left hand side. Is this allowed? The equivalent code in scala arises an error since a statement like val x = x + 10 \n",
    "in sacla is forbidden. "

A different choice can be made called dynamic scoping which would resolve  the variable not at the time when f is resolved but for when f is actually called. \n",
