    "# Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You have 2 options to run this project: (jdk + IntelliJ) or (jdk + sbt + text editor).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (The community edition is fine, though students can get Ultimate for free) with the Scala plugin installed. This makes compiling and running the project a cinch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build, run, and test this project you will need JDK8 and either IntelliJ + scala plugin or sbt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will walk through installing everything necessary on the CU VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing IntelliJ IDEA on Linux\n",
    "1. Install default jdk `sudo apt-get install default-jdk` (Note: this is not needed for the CU VM)\n",
    "2. Download the .tar.gz file. Download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).\n",
    "3. Open a terminal and `cd ~/Downloads`\n",
    "4. Run `sudo tar xf ideaIC-2018.3.4.tar.gz -C /opt/`\n",
    "5. Run `cd /opt/idea-IC-183.5429.30/`\n",
    "6. Run `./bin/idea.sh` \n",
    "7. Go through the installer (**when you get to feeatured plugins make sure to install scala**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing intelliJ IDEA on Windows\n",
    "1. Download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and run the installer.\n",
    "2. Run IntelliJ through the start menu.\n",
    "3. Note: this appeared to work with no JDK installation when I tried it, the windows intellij installer comes with its own JDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup the Scala Plugin\n",
    "1. On the welcome screen, click configure->settings to install the scala plugin ![title](welcome_configure.png)\n",
    "2. Select plugins on the left hand side of the screen and search for `Scala`. ![title](install_plugin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import Project\n",
    "1. On the welcome screen for intellij (after initial run), select import project. ![title](import.png)\n",
    "2. Select the `build.sbt` file on the import screen (Important: select the build.sbt and not the directory!). ![title](import_build.png)\n",
    "3. Leave all import settings as they are.\n",
    "4. Wait for the import to complete, there should be a progress bar on the bottom right of the screen.\n",
    "5. Navigate to the file `src/test/scala/edu/colorado/csci3155/project1` in the project panel on the right side of the screen.  Open `CompilerTest.scala`.\n",
    "6. If you are asked to install the scala sdk, click the install button ![title](sdk_1.png).\n",
    "7. Close the project in IntelliJ.\n",
    "8. From within the project directory copy the directory `runConfigurations` to the `.idea` directory. `cp -r runConfigurations .idea/`\n",
    "9. Reopen the project in IntelliJ\n",
    "8. Select `EditConfigurations` from the run menu. ![title](edit_config.png)\n",
    "9. In the confugurations window, navigate to both 'Application/Run Main' and 'ScalaTest/Run Scala Tests' for the next step.\n",
    "10. Make sure the project module is selected for each run configuration ![title](config_module.png)\n",
    "11. Select the \"Run Main\" configuration and click the play button: ![title](run_main.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The import was successful if you see the following error when running the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Exception in thread \"main\" scala.NotImplementedError: an implementation is missing`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the exception that is thrown when a `???` is encountered.  You must delete these and replace them with your implementations for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get the error:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Error: Could not find or load main class edu.colorado.csci3155.project1.Main`\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the \"Run Scala Tests\" configuration from the dropdown menu, and click the play button. This will run the project tests, which will fail since the implementation is missing. After this completes select the \"Run Main\" and click play. The import was successful if you see the following error when running the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Exception in thread \"main\" scala.NotImplementedError: an implementation is missing`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get the following exception while importing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "error: error while loading String, class file '/modules/java.base/java/lang/String.class' is broken\n",

    "You need to select a newer java version.  We tested it using OpenJDK 11 and 13.  Note that you can select which version of java IntelliJ uses with the `Project Structure` dialog available in the file menu.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Ubuntu Linux, you can install the OpenJDK 11 with `apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk` or the latest jdk with `apt-get install default-jdk`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, if you are unable to use the JDK bundled with intellij, download the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using an older version of scala (2.12 or before) you may need an older JDK. Select the relevent installer from [this page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).\n",
